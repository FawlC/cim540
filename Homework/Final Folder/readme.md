## Final Project Idea

<p><i>I was thinking of a flower growing interaction. A pot has a small sprout, i use a button to grow a flower from a sprout , to a larger vine, into a final flower.
Once you click that button to grow the plant you hear a water sound, or maybe a MouseX variable with water droplets? 
I was also thinking of another button to change the color of the pot , and or background. </i></p>
