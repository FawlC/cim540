### <p> I wanted to create a flower growth character interaction design. It starts with a pot and a mouse pressed botton function. Once the button is pressed the rain starts and then the flower grows. I got the rain function from a particle library, and i wanted these particles to reach a certain point in the x-axis where the pot is, to trigger 3 "stems" that grow a flower. i used "if" statements to display these stems, and the flower. If the particles reach the x position of the pot , stem 1 is displayed, if stem 1 is shown, stem 2 is displayed, and finally the flower displays once stem 2 is shown. </p>
